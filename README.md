# Palindrome Detector

This is the final sample app for [*Learn Enough Ruby to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/ruby-tutorial) by Michael Hartl. It is a static site made using Sinatra in Ruby to detect palindromes. The finished sample app can be found [here](https://floating-lake-34874.herokuapp.com/).

## Setup

After cloning the repo, follow these steps to get the app working:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake           # Verifies that the test suite is green
$ bundle exec rerun app.rb   # Runs the app on http://localhost:4567
```
